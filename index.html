Hello, and welcome to Selected Hacks, the personal website of Parker Timmins.
I'm a software engineer with a interest in Database systems and Geospatial systems.
I recently finished a Master's degree focused on Databases at the Technical University of Munich.
Please check out the <a href="/projects.html">Projects</a> and <a href="/blog.html">Blog</a> pages to see some of my work.
I've been a bit busy with school for the past couple years, so most of what you find on this site is a bit older and focuses on geospatial tools.
If you wish to contact me, my email is the domain name of this site, at the webmail service hosted by the largest search engine company.
